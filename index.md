# Digital Rain in C++

This blog is an overview of my work done for my C++ project.

## First Steps
The first thing I worked on was created the constructors for my project. I wanted the constructors to be relevant to the project so i added in height, width and charset which would focus on the charcacters chosen for the digital rain. 















Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Code can be highlighted with 'backticks'.

Hyperlinks look like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list:

- vectors
- algorithms
- iterators

You can add an impage that has been uploaded to the repository in a /docs/assets/images folder.
